# Credit Score Prediction Model

## Overview of this project

This project aims to utilize data science techniques to analyze and visualize banking and credit-related data, building an ML model that can classify individuals into credit score ranges. The intelligent system developed through this project will automate the credit scoring process, reducing manual labor and providing a more accurate and efficient way to determine credit scores.

## Introduction

The accurate prediction of credit scores is crucial for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of individuals. Traditional methods often involve manual processing of large datasets, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. This project leverages machine learning to automate the credit scoring process, improving accuracy and efficiency.

## Methodology

The project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training:** Building and training machine learning models using the selected features.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model parameters to enhance performance.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the model using various metrics.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection is a crucial step in this project. By selecting the most relevant features, we aim to:

- Reduce the complexity of the model.
- Improve the accuracy and performance of the model.
- Provide insights into the most important factors affecting credit scores.

## Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

We employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with an RBF kernel, using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. This process helps in identifying the best parameters for the model, ensuring optimal performance.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including:

- **Confusion Matrix:** To visualize the accuracy of the model's predictions.
- **Classification Report:** To assess precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) Score:** To measure the agreement between predicted and actual credit scores.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning to predict credit scores. The automated system developed here provides a more accurate and efficient way to determine credit scores, reducing the need for manual data analysis. This can significantly benefit financial institutions by improving their decision-making processes and reducing operational costs.

## Potential Improvements

Future improvements to this project could include:

- Incorporating additional data sources to improve model accuracy.
- Exploring other machine learning algorithms for better performance.
- Developing a user-friendly interface for easy deployment and use by financial institutions.
