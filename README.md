# Credit Score Prediction Model

## Overview of this project

This project aims to utilize data science techniques to analyze and visualize banking and credit-related data, building an ML model that can classify individuals into credit score ranges. The intelligent system developed through this project will automate the credit scoring process, reducing manual labor and providing a more accurate and efficient way to determine credit scores.

## Introduction

Accurately predicting credit scores is essential for financial institutions to evaluate an individual's creditworthiness. Traditional approaches typically rely on manual processing of extensive datasets, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project utilizes machine learning to automate the credit scoring process, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.

## Methodology

The project follows several essential steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis
2. **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most important features to boost model performance
3. **Model Training:** Building and training machine learning models using the selected features
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning model parameters to optimize performance
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's accuracy and effectiveness using various metrics

## Feature Selection

Feature selection is a crucial step in this project. By selecting the most relevant features, we aim to:

- Reduce the model's complexity
- Improve the model's accuracy and performance
- Gain insights into the key factors influencing credit scores

## Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

We employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with an RBF kernel, using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. This process helps in identifying the best parameters for the model, ensuring optimal performance.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including:

- **Confusion Matrix:** To visualize the accuracy of the model's predictions.
- **Classification Report:** To assess precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) Score:** To measure the agreement between predicted and actual credit scores.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning to predict credit scores. The automated system developed here provides a more accurate and efficient way to determine credit scores, reducing the need for manual data analysis. This can significantly benefit financial institutions by improving their decision-making processes and reducing operational costs.

## Potential Improvements

Future improvements to this project could include:

- Incorporating additional data sources to improve model accuracy.
- Exploring other machine learning algorithms for better performance.
- Developing a user-friendly interface for easy deployment and use by financial institutions.
